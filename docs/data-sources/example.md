# Data Sources

The Kind provider currently does not implement any data sources. All functionality is provided through the `kind_cluster` resource.

## Available Resources

- [`kind_cluster`](../resources/example.md) - Manages a Kind Kubernetes cluster

## Future Data Sources

Potential data sources that could be added in future versions:

- `kind_clusters` - List all available Kind clusters
- `kind_node_images` - List available Kind node images
- `kind_kubeconfig` - Retrieve kubeconfig for an existing cluster

If you have suggestions for data sources that would be useful, please open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/scale67/terraform-provider-kind).
