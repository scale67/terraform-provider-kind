# Functions

The Kind provider currently does not implement any functions. All functionality is provided through the `kind_cluster` resource.

## Available Resources

- [`kind_cluster`](../resources/example.md) - Manages a Kind Kubernetes cluster

## Future Functions

Potential functions that could be added in future versions:

- `kind_validate_config` - Validate Kind configuration YAML
- `kind_merge_config` - Merge multiple Kind configuration files
- `kind_default_config` - Generate default Kind configuration

If you have suggestions for functions that would be useful, please open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/scale67/terraform-provider-kind).
