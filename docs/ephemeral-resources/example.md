# Ephemeral Resources

The Kind provider currently does not implement any ephemeral resources. All functionality is provided through the `kind_cluster` resource.

## Available Resources

- [`kind_cluster`](../resources/example.md) - Manages a Kind Kubernetes cluster

## About Ephemeral Resources

Ephemeral resources in Terraform are resources that are created and destroyed within a single Terraform run, making them ideal for temporary operations or data processing tasks. While the Kind provider doesn't currently implement ephemeral resources, the `kind_cluster` resource itself is designed to be ephemeral in nature - clusters are typically created for testing or development purposes and destroyed when no longer needed.

## Future Ephemeral Resources

Potential ephemeral resources that could be added in future versions:

- `kind_cluster_test` - Create a temporary cluster for running tests
- `kind_cluster_benchmark` - Create a cluster for performance benchmarking
- `kind_cluster_demo` - Create a cluster for demonstrations

If you have suggestions for ephemeral resources that would be useful, please open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/scale67/terraform-provider-kind).
